# RaffoSynth for Move Everything

Monophonic synthesizer module based on [RaffoSynth](https://github.com/nicoroulet/RaffoSynth) by Nicolas Roulet and Julian Palladino.

Features 4 oscillators, a Moog-style ladder filter, and dual ADSR envelopes.

## Features

- Monophonic with last-note priority and key stacking
- 4 oscillators with 4 waveforms each (triangle, sawtooth, square, pulse)
- Per-oscillator volume, octave range, and fine detune
- Moog-style 4-pole ladder filter with resonance
- Separate amplitude and filter ADSR envelopes
- Glide/portamento
- LFO with pitch and filter modulation
- Noise generator
- Mod wheel and pitch bend support
- 14 factory presets
- Works standalone or as a sound generator in Signal Chain patches

## Prerequisites

- [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything) installed on your Ableton Move
- SSH access enabled: http://move.local/development/ssh

## Install

### Via Module Store (Recommended)

1. Launch Move Everything on your Move
2. Select **Module Store** from the main menu
3. Navigate to **Sound Generators** → **RaffoSynth**
4. Select **Install**

### Build from Source

Requires Docker (recommended) or ARM64 cross-compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything-moog
cd move-anything-moog
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Up/Down | Octave transpose (-3 to +3) |
| Jog wheel | Browse presets / navigate menus |
| Knobs 1-8 | Adjust parameters for current category |

In Shadow UI / Signal Chain, parameters are organized into navigable categories.

## Troubleshooting

**No sound:**
- This is a monophonic synth - only one note plays at a time
- Check that Osc1 volume is above zero
- Try a different preset

**Thin sound:**
- Turn up Osc2, Osc3, and/or Osc4 volumes for a fatter tone
- Add slight detune on Osc2 for classic thickness

**Filter self-oscillation:**
- High resonance with low cutoff will cause the filter to ring
- This is authentic Moog behavior - lower resonance to tame it
